# Time-siries-analysis-for-favorita-stores
Welcome to the Corporation Favorita Store Sales Forecasting project! Our goal is to predict store sales for Corporation Favorita, a leading grocery retailer in Ecuador. By using advanced time series forecasting and analytics, we aim to create a model that accurately forecasts unit sales across various items in different Favorita stores.

# Introduction
This project addresses the challenge of predicting store sales using time series forecasting techniques. We work with a diverse dataset that includes information about dates, store details, product information, promotional activities, sales figures, and more. Our ultimate goal is to provide Corporation Favorita with data-driven insights to optimize inventory management, promotional strategies, and overall business performance.

# Project Description
- Title: Enhancing Store Sales Forecasting for Corporation Favorita

- Objective: Develop a robust time series forecasting model to predict store sales for Corporation Favorita, delivering accurate predictions for unit sales across various items in different Favorita stores.

# Methodology To achieve our objectives, we will follow these steps:

- Data Exploration: Thoroughly explore the datasets to understand the available features, their distributions, and relationships. This step will provide initial insights into the store sales data and help identify any data quality issues.

- Data Preparation: Handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and encode categorical variables as necessary. Techniques such as imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding may be used.

- Time Series Analysis: Analyze the temporal aspects of the data, including trends, seasonality, and potential outliers. This will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns in-store sales over time.

- Model Selection and Training: Select and train appropriate time series forecasting models using the prepared data. Consider incorporating external factors like promotions, holidays, and oil prices to enhance forecasting accuracy.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Assess the models' performance and identify the most accurate and reliable forecasting model.

- Model Deployment and Forecasting: Deploy the chosen model to predict store sales for future periods using the test dataset. Generate forecasts for the target period and assess the model's accuracy in capturing sales patterns.

# Scope
The project involves exploring and analyzing a comprehensive dataset, including dates, store details, product information, promotional activities, and sales figures. Supplementary files with additional information will be used to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models.

# Data Overview The project utilizes several datasets, including:

- train.csv: Training data with features such as store number, product family, onpromotion, and sales.

- test.csv: Test data for predicting target sales for the 15 days after the last date in the training data.

- transaction.csv: Information about transactions made on specific dates.

- sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file in the correct format.

- stores.csv: Store metadata, including city, state, type, and cluster.

- oil.csv: Daily oil prices, given Ecuador's dependency on oil.

- holidays_events.csv: Holidays and events metadata, including information about transferred holidays.

# Hypothesis and Analytical Questions
# Hypothesis

- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in sales between promoted and non-promoted items.

- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Promoted items have significantly higher sales compared to non-promoted items.

# Analytical Questions
- Do items on promotion sell more, and is this difference statistically significant?

- Are sales different between different types of stores?

- Does the daily oil price correlate with overall sales?

- Do sales change significantly during holidays?

- Do some products consistently sell more during certain seasons?

- Do sales patterns vary depending on the day of the week?

# Model Development
I will select appropriate time series forecasting models, train them using the prepared data, and incorporate external factors if available. The models will be optimized by tuning hyperparameters to select the best-performing model.

# Model Evaluation
I will evaluate the trained models using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MSE, or MAPE. The models will be interpreted to understand the factors driving store sales and their relative importance.

# Project Deliverables
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering documentation

- Trained time series forecasting models

# Model evaluation and performance analysis
Final project report summarizing findings, insights, and recommendations

# Conclusion
This project aims to predict store sales accurately using time series forecasting techniques. By leveraging the provided datasets and following the outlined methodology, I aim to provide valuable insights to Corporation Favorita and develop a reliable forecasting model for store sales. This project will enable informed decision-making, optimize inventory management, and improve overall sales performance for the company. Our ultimate goal is to build a model that accurately predicts unit sales for thousands of items.
